Please read the following if you wish to contribute to Volume+ development/discussion.

## Need help or have a question?
If you wish to ask a question or to participate in discussions, please visit our Discussions page on GitHub.
Please do not submit issues to the repo for your questions!

## Found something you want to add/fix?
Write up & submit a pull request and contact me! I will find time to look over it and decide what to do from there.
Please verify that what you are attempting to add/fix hasn't already been submitted by someone else!
If someone has already submitted your suggestion/fix and was rejected and you believe you have a substantial case for why it should not have been rejected, feel free to expand on the existing submission.
